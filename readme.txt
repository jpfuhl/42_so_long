42 | so_long

Welcome to my version of so_long!

You will help a fire demon collect flames until he gets powerful enough to
unleash his true powers and travel to a distant dimension,
only to create chaos and set the world on fire!

You can walk with WASD and change your looking direction with Q and E.
The game will finish automatically, if you collect all flames and leave through the portal.
Or, if you choose to leave earlier, you can press ESC or click the red cross.

You can pass any map in .ber format, as long as it respects the rules:
- Must consist only of 1 (walls), 0 (floors), C (collectibles), E (exit) and P (player).
- There must be at least 1 collectible, 1 exit and 1 player.
- Map must be rectangular and no empty lines.
